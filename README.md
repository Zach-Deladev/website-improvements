## 1. INTRODUCTION

In this assignment, I was tasked to improve a website's functionality and design based on a short brief. Here is my solution.

## 2. INITIAL THOUGHTS

### AREAS TO IMPROVE

    1.  Navgiation bar is basic and unresponsive.
    2.  Page is cluttered with unrelated information.
    3.  The flow of information doesn't make sense, there needs to be a clear flow of information so the user can easily understand what the site is offering.
    4.  No branding.
    5.  Functionality doesn't work correctly.
    6.  Gallery is very basic, no way to view images in larger size.
    7.  Contact form has no form validation.
    8.  Footer is poorly designed and does not function in the way intended.

9.  No clear call to action.

### IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT

    1.  Create a responsive and clear navigation thats user friendly on all device sizes.
    2.  Organise the site so infomation is easily digestible.
    3.  Create a clear page structure.
    4.  Create unique branding for user recognition.
    5.  Fix functionality issues using javascript.
    6.  Create a clear gallery that has lightbox style functionality.
    7.  Implement form validation.
    8.  Design a clear and responsive footer.
    9.  Use UX design princles to highlight call to action buttons.
